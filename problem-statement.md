# Problem Statement
## Employee Performance Prediction Using HR Data

Human resources (HR) data contains valuable insights into employee performance, work habits, and retention patterns. In this challenge, you are tasked with developing a predictive model that can forecast future employee performance or retention based on historical HR data, such as performance reviews, work hours, and other relevant employee metrics.
### Your goal is to build a model that can predict:
 1. Future performance ratings or scores for employees.
 2. Likelihood of an employee’s retention or potential to leave the company.
 3. Factors that influence an employee’s performance or risk of leaving, such as work hours, job satisfaction, department, and tenure. You should leverage machine learning techniques such as classification or regression models to predict employee performance or retention. The solution  may involve feature engineering, dealing with missing or imbalanced data, and selecting the most relevant features for making predictions.
### The output of your model should include:
1. Predicted performance scores or future performance ratings for employees.
2. Predicted likelihood of retention or employee turnover.
3. Insights into the key factors influencing employee performance or retention.
 The model’s accuracy should be evaluated based on standard evaluation
 metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score (for classification tasks), or
 RMSE (for regression tasks).
### Datasets
### You can use the following datasets to develop and test your employee performance prediction model:
 1. IBM HR Analytics: A popular dataset on employee performance and
 retention, available on Kaggle. It includes various employee metrics like
 performance ratings, age, work hours, and more.
 2. Employee Attrition and Performance: A dataset that contains in
formation about employee attrition and performance reviews, available on
 Kaggle.
 3. HR Analytics Dataset: This dataset contains information about em
ployee job satisfaction, work-life balance, and other HR metrics, which
 can be found at Kaggle.
4. UCI HR Analytics Dataset: A dataset from the UCI Machine Learn
ing Repository that focuses on employee turnover prediction, available at
 UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 5. OpenML Datasets: OpenML offers multiple HR-related datasets, in
cluding employee performance and retention data, available at OpenML.
 These datasets include a wide range of features related to employee perfor
mance, satisfaction, and retention. You can use them to train and evaluate your
 predictive model
